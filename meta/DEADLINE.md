    This app, Sunshine Statistics, functions to provide users the sunset, sunrise, solar noon, and day lengths of the top 10 sunrise/sunset points in the country. The user can select a zip code of the location and click the go button for the application to generate all this infotmation. On the back end, I utilized the Zippopotam.us API which uses the zip code to find the state, city, latitude, and longditude of it. From there, my second API, sunrise-sunset.org, uses the longditude and latitude points retrieved from the first API to provide the sunrise, sunset, solar noon, and day length times of the coordinates!

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

While working on this project I learned several new things such as how to add font color, backgrounds, and images to a JavaFX application.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start the project over again something I might do differently is to spend a couple days brainstorming before I even start coding the project. I would prepare by understanding how  the API's function, drawing out my end results, and taking notes of my ideas.
